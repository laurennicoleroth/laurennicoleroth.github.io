> The interesting thing was, they couldn’t make up their minds. The theologians essentially said, well, she seems to be pious, she seems to be virtuous, we can’t fault her personal bearing. But we can’t be sure that her message comes from God. What they recommended was she should be put to the test, a practical test, and there was a practical test conveniently ready to hand, because the town of Orléans had been under siege by the English for months. And the suggestion arose that she should be sent to Orléans with some soldiers to see what she could do. And that’s how Joan of Arc got her army.

## What does it mean to the nobles in this court that she’s a woman? How do they read that fact?

> It was a profound challenge to everything they thought they knew about the world they lived in. Women did not fight. God had ordained the world to work in particular ways, and one of those ways was that men were to lead, men were to rule, men were to fight. and women were not to do those things. Women were to stay at home and bear children and support their menfolk. So the idea that such a young woman—any woman—but such a young woman step forward and say that God had sent her to fight was profoundly destabilizing. It could only really work in the context of the miraculous. Because god could choose to work a miracle through any vessel he liked and if he were going to work a miracle, then perhaps a teenage peasant girl was a particularly miraculous way to do it.

> And she wasn’t only a girl—she was a girl dressed as a boy. Which adds another of challenge, because the book of Deuteronomy in the Old Testament says that a woman dressed as a man is an abomination unto the lord. It is an absolute overturning of what God meant for his creation, the proper ordering of the world. So Joan in every sense challenged expectations, assumptions, about what was normal and normally right. But that was in a sense part of her power, part of her charisma, once it had been decided to give her a chance.

>There are contemporary accounts of her when she arrived in Orléans and was able to slip into The town through the English cordon, of being greeted as though she were an angel from God. The townspeople were so desperate for salvation that they crowded around her, believing that the miracle was about to happen. Joan of course also believed that the miracle was about to happen. And her strategy—many historians have talked of her remarkable military brain and talked as though she were a subtle strategist. I can’t see that at all. It just seems to me that wherever she fights, she has one strategy, which is attack, now, in the name of God. But that was exactly what was needed at Orléans in 1429 to galvanize the Armagnac cause, to feel suddenly some belief that they could perhaps win, that they were about to make a difference.
